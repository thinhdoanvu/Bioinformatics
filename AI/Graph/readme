A graph is a set of nodes or known number of vertices. When these vertices are paired together, we call it edges. An Edge is a line from one node to other. Every edge can have its cost or weight.
Graphs are two types Directed and Undirected. Directed graphs are the graphs in which the vertices are ordered and in undirected graphs the vertices are unordered.
An Adjacency matrix is a finite set of values used to create an easy way to look for an edge. If the value at 0th row and 1st column are zero, it means the edge does not exist.
  0 1 2 3 4
0 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1
2 0 1 0 1 0
3 0 1 1 0 1
4 1 1 0 1 0
In the example above, the program is made to create an adjacency matrix for either of Directed or Undirected type of graph.
The Program will ask for the number of nodes then the directed or undirected graph. After that it will ask for the values of the node. In the end, it will print the matrix.
The Adjacency matrix is the 2-D array of integers.
